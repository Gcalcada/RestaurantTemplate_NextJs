## Getting Started

Just a basic template developed with next.js + tailwind css

light mode and dark mode fully implemented,animations.... 

it's just a front end with a Json file for put the data of the restaurant on the menu and for payments details etc. it's all front end...

things for develop : notification when I click on buy a food from menu the user needs to know it's on the cart. I have two different buttons on details you can buy and you move into the cart with the quantity that you want.

the page of reservations of the table need to be improved I'm thinking in put another Json with the amount of tables that we could reserve online and try to save who made the reservation.

needs to be done a page for payments. and probably I'm forget something right now.
